# SofitContainer
SofitContainer is a Cordova project, Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows using standard web technologies such as, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development. So, basically [Sofit](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/Sofit.git) web application executes within wrappers targeted to each platform, reply on standards compliant API bindings to access each device's capabilities such as sensors, data (Contact list, battery status), network status, etc. 


## How to run this app

**Install the Cordova CLI**
1. Download and install Node.js. This will allow you to install Cordova and other libraries/packages. You can find the download link here:

   https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  
2. Install the **cordova** module using **npm** utility of Node.js. The **cordova** module will automatically be downloaded by the **npm** utility. 

   **on OS X and Linux:**\
   _$ sudo npm install -g cordova_

   **on Windows:**\
   _c:\> npm install -g cordova_

NOTE: The -g flag above tells npm to install cordova globally. Otherwise, it will be installed in the **node_modules** subdirectory of the current working directory.

## Create the App
In the next step, Go to the directory where you maintain your source code, and create a cordova project. 

_$ cordova create sofitCotainer com.example.hello SofitCotainer_

This creates the required directory structure for your cordova app. 

## Add Platforms

All subsequent commands need to be run within the projectâ€™s directory, or any subdirectories:

_$ cd sofitConatiner_

Add the platforms that you want to target your app. We will add the **"ios"** and **"android"** platform and ensure they get saved to **config.xml** and **package.json**:

_$ cordova platform add ios_ 

_$ cordova platform add android_

To check your current set of platforms:

_$ cordova platform ls_

## Install pre-requisites for building 
To build and run apps, you need to install SDKs for each platform you wish to target. Alternatively, if you are using a browser for development you can use **browser** platform which does not require any platform SDKs. 

To check if you satisfy requirements for building the platform:

``` cordova requirements
Requirements check results for android:
Java JDK: installed.
Android SDK: installed
Android target: installed android-19,android-21,android-22,android-23,Google Inc.:Google APIs:19,Google Inc.:Google APIs (x86 System Image):19,Google Inc.:Google APIs:23
Gradle: installed

The requirements check results for ios:
Apple OS X: not installed
Cordova tooling for iOS requires Apple OS X
Error: Some of requirements check failed
```

After, satisfying all requirements, clone the project from [SofitContainer](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/SofitContainer.git) inside a created directory. 

At last but not least, Open your project in **Android Studio** (Note: you can use your favorite IDE like VS Code). Run command **npm install** in the terminal. With the help of this command, all required packages will install automatically. 

Run command **cordova run android**, if you are using an android phone or android emulator for testing purposes. 



# Final words
Be aware of file permission issues and preconfigured paths to executables (system env versus virtual env)!

Have fun, TESOBE
